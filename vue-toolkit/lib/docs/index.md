# 📚 Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for `@geoffjamieson/vue-toolkit`.

This toolkit includes reusable Vue 3 components, with plans to expand into animations, utilities, and more.  
All tools are designed to be lightweight, flexible, and easy to customize — especially when paired with Tailwind CSS.
